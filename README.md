Pacman-Clone
============

A Pacman clone made in Unity followed tutorials from [noobtuts](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game). In addition to the tutorial, the original AI is implemented with the help of [Game Internals](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior) as well as menus, high scores and a few additional levels.

See [Shaunew's Pac-Man](http://pacman.shaunew.com/play/index.htm) to see how each ghost's AI works.
